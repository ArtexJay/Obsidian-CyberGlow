# Obsidian-CyberGlow

A pleasant Minimalist looking theme, with glow effects and accent color support. Many minimalist or clean themes are very monotone and dull/depressing to look at in order to keep you focused. However my theme strikes a great balance of colorful, glowy with little to no distractions in the UI and useable with a cursor.

The old interface of this theme was good but it didn't look nearly as good with the tabs, some selector choices were strange and looked quite dated. v7 of CyberGlow reworked those dated looking interfaces to be more modern. Custom accent colors should be more readable than in prior versions.

A formerly a mix of TriDiamond's Obsidianite and Deathau's 80s Glow themes for Obsidian.md but has gradually transformed into its own unique, minimalist and clean theme.
