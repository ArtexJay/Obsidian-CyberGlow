# Obsidian-CyberGlow

A pleasant Minimalist looking theme, with glow effects. Many minimalist or clean themes are very monotone and dull/depressing to look at in order to keep you focused. However my theme strikes a great balance of colorful, glowy with little to no distractions in the UI and useable with a cursor.

A mix of TriDiamond's Obsidianite and Deathau's 80s Glow themes for Obsidian.md but has gradually transformed into its own unique, minimalist and clean theme.
